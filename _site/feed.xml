        <title>Google Summer of Code : Week 1</title>
        <description>&lt;h1&gt; Google Summer of Code : Week 1&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the community bonding period is still on, this week was low on commits and more on discussing the plans for the project.
One day was spent on setting up the earlier version of &lt;a href=&quot;github.com/gambitproject/gte&quot;&gt;GTE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-setup&quot;&gt;The Setup&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My project was partly motivated for getting over the tedious process of the previous version of GTE. The previous version was in flash and I am yet to understand its code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-prs&quot;&gt;The PR’s&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile I also added a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gambitproject/jsgte/pull/89&quot;&gt;feature&lt;/a&gt;. It involves making the settings panel draggable. Though there are other things to be implemented but it is a start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-future&quot;&gt;The Future&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was going through this library called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WebReflection/circular-json/&quot;&gt;circular-json&lt;/a&gt; which would help me implement the save/load feature in jsgte. The major problem with saving and loading in jsgte is that the prototypes are circular and end up referencing each other. circular-json tends to overcome this yet there seems to be a bug when I used it in jsgte. Anyways I submitted for an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WebReflection/circular-json/issues/24&quot;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; with those guys. Lets see if we can find a fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was pretty much it this week. The next week would be more productive in terms of commits I think. I plan to complete the exporting to image formats feature this week and start working on the save/load from json format as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mugs and Glory&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Google Summer of Code</title>
        <description>&lt;h1&gt; Google Summer of Code &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my first blog post in the series where I’ll be posting my updates about GSoC 2016.
I’ll start from the beginning. 
I started doing open source a year back when I was introduced to this awesome campus group SDSLabs, here at IIT Roorkee.
I worked on some internal projects, biggest one being a chess playing platform for the intranet of IIT Roorkee. It mainly involved javascript as the language. 
I was previously contributing to the Processing foundation. I really liked the work that they were doing and was enjoying the experience. But they didn’t get selected as a GSoC organisation this year. 
I was introduced to Gambit while I was scrolling through this years organisations selected in GSoC. I found their work interesting and the project quite optimum to my capabilities.
I went through the code in the month of March and April and started contributing. I loved interacting with the mentors who were very helpful along the way and since I loved the work that they were offering, I didn’t apply for any other organisation.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt; The Project &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My project revolves around porting the flash version of the Game theory explorer to Javascript which would make further development easier. 
I have made my proposal open and it can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qbIrPj-IAaJ1FzWCzDp2vmbaC40A5X8ZdSLrjtCm0eg/edit#&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The github repository containing the current code of the project can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gambitproject/jsgte&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
I’m currently in the middle of my community bonding period and am looking forward to an awesome adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;h3&gt;It is going to be an interesing summer!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
