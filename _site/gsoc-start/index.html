I’ll start from the beginning. I started doing open source a year back when I was introduced to this awesome campus group SDSLabs, here at IIT Roorkee. I worked on some internal projects, biggest one being a chess playing platform for the intranet of IIT Roorkee. It mainly involved javascript as the language. I was previously contributing to the Processing foundation. I really liked the work that they were doing and was enjoying the experience. But they didn’t get selected as a GSoC organisation this year. I was introduced to Gambit while I was scrolling through this years organisations selected in GSoC. I found their work interesting and the project quite optimum to my capabilities. I went through the code in the month of March and April and started contributing. I loved interacting with the mentors who were very helpful along the way and since I loved the work that they were offering, I didn’t apply for any other organisation. <br /></p> <h1> The Project </h1> <p>My project revolves around porting the flash version of the Game theory explorer to Javascript which would make further development easier. I have made my proposal open and it can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qbIrPj-IAaJ1FzWCzDp2vmbaC40A5X8ZdSLrjtCm0eg/edit#">here</a><br /> The github repository containing the current code of the project can be found <a href="https://github.com/gambitproject/jsgte">here</a>. I’m currently in the middle of my community bonding period and am looking forward to an awesome adventure.</p> <center><h3>It is going to be an interesing summer!</h3></center> </div> </article> <footer class="site-footer"> <div class="container"> <ul class="social"> <li><a href="http://github.com/hkirat" target="_blank"><i class="icon icon-github"></i></a></li> </ul> <p> <small>&copy;2016 All rights reserved.
